Token- and latency-efficient retrieval-augmented generation via a persistent reasoning subgraph. The approach combines edge-space retrieval with frontier sentence encodings and top-m reranking, achieving similar accuracy with far fewer tokens and lower generation latency.

Status: under review (VLDB submission). Link will be added after acceptance.
