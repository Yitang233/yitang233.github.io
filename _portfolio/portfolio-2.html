Co-built a data pipeline for long videos: world-knowledge taxonomy → YouTube retrieval → metadata, subtitle-density, and motion filtering. Generated subtitle-to-description narratives and trained long-context VLMs (up to 224K tokens, 400 frames). Automated evaluation on Video-MME, V-NIAH, MLVU, and LVBench.
