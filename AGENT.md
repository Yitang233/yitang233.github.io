Site structure overview
- Jekyll/AcademicPages template with content and config split: `_config.yml` (site metadata, author profile, publication categories, collections) and `_data/navigation.yml` (header links: Publications, Talks, Teaching, Portfolio, Blog Posts, CV, Guide). Content collections live in `_pages` (home at `/`, CV pages, publications/talks/teaching/portfolio archives, blog archives, guide), `_posts` (blog), `_publications`, `_talks`, `_teaching`, and `_portfolio`; `_drafts` holds unpublished posts. `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, and `assets` define the theme structure and styling; `_site` is the generated output and should not be edited. Support assets reside in `images/`, `files/` (downloadable artifacts such as CVs), and `talkmap/` plus `talkmap.py` for map generation. `markdown_generator/` contains notebooks/scripts to convert CSV/TSV data into Markdown for talks/publications. Tooling and infrastructure are provided via `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` (Ruby/Jekyll deps), `package.json` (JS deps/build scripts), `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yaml` + `.devcontainer/` (containerized dev), and `scripts/` for helpers.

Environment notes
- Repo intended to run in VS Code Dev Container; avoid relying on host-specific commands or network access. Local preview typically comes from the container running `jekyll serve`, but per instructions I have not attempted to run or build anything here.
- Sidebar avatar: place your profile image at `images/profile.png` (matches `_config.yml` author avatar setting). Use the same filename to avoid further config changes.

README highlights
- Root `README.md` documents how to fork/use the Academic Pages template, configure `_config.yml` and `navigation.yml`, upload assets to `files/`, and optionally generate Markdown via the provided notebooks. It outlines local setup with Ruby/bundler/node, and containerized options via Docker Compose or the VS Code Dev Container (auto-hosts the site at `http://localhost:4000` when reopened in container).

Plan to align site content with `files/cv.tex`
- Files/Downloads: keep `files/cv.tex` as source of truth; compile to `files/cv.pdf` for download buttons in `cv-json.md`; ensure any referenced artifacts (papers, slides) are placed under `files/`.
- Site metadata: update `_config.yml` author fields with name/location/email/description reflecting HKUST CS student focused on inference-time control and long-context AI; set social/contact links where available (GitHub, LinkedIn/GS/ORCID if provided), and adjust avatar path once a profile photo is added to `images/`.
- Homepage (`_pages/about.md`): replace template copy with a concise intro (HKUST CS BEng ’26, research in inference-time LM control, efficient RAG, long-context VLMs), plus a short highlight list (key research areas, current FYT at LONG Group, VLDB submission, scholarships) and contact info.
- CV pages: rewrite `_pages/cv.md` to mirror CV sections and ordering—Education; Research Experience; Teaching Experience; Projects & Training; Honors & Awards; Skills & Interests (merge Service into honors if none); keep HTML list includes for publications/talks/teaching where they align. Update `_data/cv.json` with the same data so `cv-json.md` reflects the CV and sidebar basics stay consistent.
- Publications: replace placeholders in `_publications/` with entries for current works. Add manuscripts for “Auto Pruned Retriever” (VLDB under review) and “Long as a Tale...” (if to be listed) with dates, venues (use “Under review”/“In preparation”), and links/bibtex placeholders under `files/` if available; remove template dummy posts.
- Talks: if no talks exist, keep the page structure but either add a “Coming soon” entry or leave empty with a short note; optionally hide `talkmap_link`. If any talks emerge, create `_talks` entries with event/location/date.
- Teaching: replace `_teaching` placeholders with the three TA roles (COMP2211 2024/2025, COMP1023 2024, COMP2012 2024) including duties and term dates; ensure archive page renders them in reverse chronological order.
- Portfolio/projects: add portfolio items for “Independent Quantitative Research” (equity data/factors stack) and for the “Long as a Tale” pipeline or “Auto Pruned Retriever” prototype, each with a short description and optional image/diagram in `images/` or `files/`.
- Blog/posts: either convert sample `_posts` into meaningful write-ups (e.g., long-video data pipeline, inference-time guidance notes) or temporarily remove the nav item after confirming; prefer rewriting over deletion.
- Navigation and UI text: keep the current nav order unless sections are intentionally hidden; update `ui-text` if labels need adjusting (e.g., “Blog Posts” → “Blog”).
