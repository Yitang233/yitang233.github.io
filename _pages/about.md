I am a BEng student in Computer Science at HKUST (expected 2026), advised by Prof. Long Chen (LONG Group). My work focuses on inference-time control of large language models, efficient retrieval for long-context systems, and multimodal/long-video learning. I spent summer 2025 in the Cornell Database Systems Lab with Prof. Sainyam Galhotra.

Currently
------
- Final Year Thesis: inference-time classifier-free guidance for autoregressive LMs; decoding/steering to reduce hallucinations; long-context evaluation.
- Cornell DB Systems Lab: Auto Pruned Retriever (VLDB submission, under review); token/latency-efficient RAG via reasoning subgraphs; scalable causal discovery.
- Long-context VLMs: co-built hour-long video data pipeline and evaluation (HKUST NLP Group).

Highlights
------
- CGA 4.126/4.30 (rank 2/145); Dean’s List every term.
- Scholarships: HKSAR Government Scholarship, APEC Scholarship, Cornell IRIS Summer Scholarship, HKUST SENG ISR Sponsorship, UROP Support Grant, and others.
- Teaching assistantships: Exploring AI (COMP2211), Intro to Python (COMP1023), OOP & Data Structures (COMP2012).
